# Four in a Row Game

This is a "Four in a Row" game developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Swing library.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in university. The goal was to create a game where two players take turns placing colored discs into a grid, attempting to align four discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win.

## Features:
- **Two-player mode** (Player vs Player)
- **Interactive game board** with clickable cells
- **Simple indicator** showing whose turn it is or who the winner is
- **Graphical interface** that draws the game board and discs

## Libraries Used:
- `javax.swing` for GUI components
- `java.awt` for graphics and event handling
